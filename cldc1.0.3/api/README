This directory contains the configuration files for 'wobulating' the CLDC
classes to add the required Trusted attributes. It contains the following
files:

cldc.batch - This is a sample configuration file for doing batch wobulation
     of the CLDC classes. It contains comments describing the type of
     configuration it represents.

cldc.keystore - This is a sample Java keystore containing the keys
     referenced in cldc.batch. Obviously, these keys should never be used
     in a real deployement.

Build Instructions
==================

To produce a "wobulated" CLDC API, follow these steps:

1. Select a destination directory for the wobulated classes (DESTDIR).
2. Enter the following command from this directory:

     svmtool Wobulator -batch cldc.batch -cp <classpath to CLDC API classes> \
          -storepass 123456 -keystore cldc.keystore -d $DESTDIR

The wobulated classes will now reside under $DESTDIR.
