<br>The Java class file "p<tt>alm.database.MakePalmApp"</tt> converts a
Java application written for the Palm into a file that can be directly
downloaded onto the Palm.
<tt>The MakePalmApp</tt> tool represents the last step for building sample
applications from Java source to produce a Palm application. Refer to
<tt>PalmReleaseNotes.pdf</tt> for instructions on how to accomplish the first two
steps (Compilation and Verification). The Java class
<i>palm.database.MakePalmApp</i> represents the main class for this
tool and converts a Java application written for the Palm into a 'prc'
file that can be directly downloaded onto the device.
<p>The Palm application will appear in your launcher just like any other
Palm application. Touching the application icon will cause it to begin
running.
<p>This documentation does not discuss how to set up the appropriate environment
variables. It is assumed that the value of the environment variable <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>
includes the zip file that contains the classes in the "p<tt>alm.database"</tt>
package.
<p>This code has been tested in all versions of JDK1.1.x., JDK1.2.x and JDK1.3.x.
This program has not been tested with any JDK1.0.x version of Java.
<p>At its simplest, you execute the program as follows:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java palm.database.MakePalmApp [&lt;options> . . .] class [class ....]</pre>
For example,
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java palm.database.MakePalmApp DragonApp</pre>
will generate a file <tt>DragonApp.prc</tt> that can be downloaded onto
the Palm.
<p>The class name given (<tt>DragonApp</tt> in the above argument) must
contain a
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(String argv[])</pre>
method, and it is this method that is called automatically when you launch
the application.
<p>There are numerous options that can precede the class name. You may
also include more than one class name, though in most cases this isn't
necessary. If you include multiple classes, the first class name specified
must be the class with the <tt>main</tt> method.
<h2>
What it does</h2>
This program converts your Java application into a resource application
file that can be downloaded onto the Palm. This application file contains
the classes necessary to run your program and the code needed to start
the KJava Virtual machine.
<p>After you download the application file, your application will appear
in the launcher, along with all the other Palm applications. Touching the
application icon starts the Java Virtual Machine.
<p>The converter tries to find all non-core classes used by your program,
and includes them into the resource file. It automatically includes all
non-core classes specified in your application, as well as all the non-core
classes that they reference.
<h2>
Options</h2>
The complete list of options is given below. If two options are given on
the same line, they are synonyms.
<br>&nbsp;

<li>
-usagename&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program name
to appear in this help message</li>
</ul>
Each of these options is described in more detail below.
<h3>
-v, -verbose</h3>
These arguments cause the program to produce more verbose output. Their
effect is cumulative. The option <tt>-v -v</tt> produces even more output
than just a single one.
<h3>
-classpath</h3>
If this argument is not specified, the program expects that it can find
all of your application's classes starting in the current directory. Thus,
for example, the class <tt>ShootEmUp.Board</tt> will be in the file <tt>./ShootEmUp/Board.class</tt>.
<p>Note that the kjava classes (see the -skiplist option) do not need
to be accessible via the classpath. They are recognized as being core classes
by their name and are not looked at.
<p>You should give a classpath argument if you are running the application
builder from a directory other than the directory in which the class files
for your application reside.
<p>The classpath argument is a list of directories and zip files. The components
of the list are separated by a colon on Unix machines, and by a semicolon
on Windows machines. Each directory or zip file is searched, in turn, for
a specific class file.
<p>Note that the CLASSPATH environment variable, or any -classpath argument
passed directly to Java are ignored. Your application should not be accessing
the same class files that "big java" is running.
<h1>
-icon, -smallicon, -listicon</h1>
Each of these takes as its argument a filename containing a bitmap. The
following formats are understood:
<ul>
<li>
Windows bitmap format (.bmp)</li>

<li>
Portable bitmap format (.pbm)</li>

<li>
Raw PalmOS format bitmaps (.bin)</li>
</ul>
The application builder uses the extension of the filename to determine
the type of bitmap that the file contains.
<p>The -icon argument indicates the file contains the bitmap that should
appear in the Palm Launcher's "icon view". The PalmOS expects this icon
to be 32x32 bitmap, in which the five left-most and right-most columns
are white, and in which the bottom most ten rows are white. If you pass
a file containing a bitmap of a different size (most common is 22x22),
the bitmap will be converted into a 32x32 bitmap by top-adjusting it and
centering it horizontally.
<p>The -smallicon argument indicates the bitmap that appears in the Launcher's
"list view." The PalmOS expects a 15x9 bitmap. If you pass a file containing
a different sized bitmap, it is converted into a 15x9 bitmap by top-adjusting
it and centering it horizontally.
<p>If either argument is omitted, your file will be given default icons.
<h3>
-JARtoPRC &lt;JAR file></h3>
The <tt>-JARtoPRC</tt> argument specifies the &lt;JAR file> containing
the application class files that are to be read from the JAR file and converted
to a Palm PRC file that can be directly downloaded onto the Palm. The JAR
file specified must be in a valid JAR (Java archive) format. The default
JAR file is to take the main class name without packages, and append ".jar"
to it. So, the default JAR file for the Dragon app would be Dragon.jar.
<h3>
-name, -longname</h3>
The <tt>-name</tt> argument specifies the name that appears under the icon
in the launcher. If this name is more than seven or eight characters long,
it may be truncated by the Launcher.
<p>The <tt>-longname</tt> argument specifies the "true" name of the application.
This name appears when you go to the launcher's Beam and Delete menus.
This name can be at most 31 characters.
<p>If you do not specify a <tt>-name</tt> argument, then the class name,
without packages is used. If you do not specify a <tt>-longname</tt> argument,
then the full class name is used.
<p>For example, if your main class is <tt>ShootEmUp.myGame</tt>, the default
name is "myGame" and the default long name is ShootEmUp.myGame".
<h3>
-output, -o</h3>
This argument specifies the name of the file to which the output is written.
This file can then be downloaded onto the Pilot.
<p>The default output file is to take the main class name without packages,
and append ".prc" to it. So <tt>ShootEmUp.myGame</tt> would be written
to <tt>myGame.prc</tt>
<p>Note that the PalmOS does not care what the name of the file is. The
correspondence between the name of the .prc file and the name of the class
is purely a convenience.
<h3>
-creator</h3>
Every Palm application is required to have a unique Creator ID. Palm recommends
that you register your unique Creator ID for each application at its Web
site.
<p>The application builder will
automatically generate a creator ID for you that is based on the name of
the main class of your application. The creator ID is constructed in such
a way that it is extremely unlikely that your creator ID will conflict with
another application.
<p>If you plan to use databases with your Java application, or plan to
do other serious long term work, you should register a 4-letter ID with
Palm, and then pass that 4-letter id as the argument to this function.
<p>When you specify <tt>-verbose -verbose</tt>, the application builder
prints out the creator ID that has been assigned to your application.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
-usagename</h3>
The default value of this argument is "java palm.database.MakePalmApp".
<p>The first line of the help message, printed out when the user gives
the <tt>-help</tt> argument or makes some other mistake, begins with the
value of this variable.
<p>If you create a batch file or shell script, you can add
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -usagename &lt;name of batch file></pre>
so that the error message will reflect the name of your batch file.
<h3>
-version &lt;string></h3>
A string indicating the "version" of this application.
<h3>
-help</h3>
Print out a help message.
<h3>
Multiple class name arguments</h3>
Under most circumstances, this program can determine all the additional
classes needed by your application.
<p>However, if your program makes use of the <tt>Class.forName</tt>, there
may be classes loaded dynamically that the application builder might not know
about. You must explicitly specify these classes.
<p>If you specify a system class as an additional class name, it will be
included as part of your application, even though it might already be in the KJava
Virtual Machine.

<h2>
What it does</h2>
This program converts your Palm resource application file into a Java application
in JAR (Java archive) format. This JAR application file contains the classes
necessary to run your program and the code needed to start the KJava Virtual
machine.
<p>The converter tries to retrieve all Palm class resources from the Palm
.PRC file and a JAR file entry is created for each of the classes and written
out to the JAR file along with its respective class data. For each of the
Java classes, a manifest entry is also generated. All the manifest entries
are dumped into the manifest file, META-INF/MANIFEST.MF, which is also
created as part of the JAR file.
<p>See "The Java Class Libraries Second Edition, Volume 1 Supplement for
the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition, v1.2" for further information on
JAR Manifest files.

<h3>
-PRCfile &lt;PRC file></h3>
The <tt>-PRCfile</tt> argument specifies the Palm application &lt;PRC file>
is to be converted to a Java application file in JAR (Java archive) format.
The .PRC file specified must be a valid Palm .PRC application file. If
no "-outfile &lt;JAR file> is specified for the name of the JAR file to
