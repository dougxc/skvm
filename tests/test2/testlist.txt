2. NFx tests

   a. [NFx false, untrusted instantiation -> fail]
      accessed class, package: X, P-trusted
        certificate: NFx false
      instantiating class, package: Y, P-untrusted
        certificate: none
      access type: Y instantiate X

	// If P.Y can't subclass object, won't instanciate.
	// Already tested in test1


   b. [NFx true, untrusted instantiation -> succeed]
      accessed class, package: X, P-trusted
        certificate: NFx true
      instantiating class, package: Y, P-untrusted
        certificate: none
      access type: Y instantiate X

   ------------This test confirms the operation of the trusted instantiation 
               privilege
   c. [NFx false, trusted instantiation -> succeed]
      accessed class, package: X, P-trusted
        certificate: NFx false
      instantiating class, package: Y, Q-trusted
        certificate: Y instantiates of X
      access type: Y instantiate X

   ------------This test confirms the operation of the domain privilege
   d. [NFx false, trusted instantiation -> succeed]
      accessed class, package: X, P-trusted
        certificate: NFx false
      instantiating class, package: Y, Q-trusted
        certificate: Y in domain of X
      access type: Y instantiate X

   ------------This test confirms the operation of the instantiation privilege
               of the subclassing privilege
   e. [NFx false, trusted instantiation -> ???]
      accessed class, package: X, P-trusted
        certificate: NFx false
      instantiating class, package: Y (subclass of X), Q-trusted
        certificate: Y subclass of X
      access type: Y instantiate X
